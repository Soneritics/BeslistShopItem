## Introduction ##
The Beslist.nl platform imports webshop inventory items using feeds. The process of feed creation,
downloading and processing all items in a feed is by nature not real-time. Therefore an API has been
developed enabling near real-time updates to a number of properties of inventory items. Within the
context of this API those webshop inventory items are referred to as ‘shopitems’ and the API is called
the ‘Shopitem API’.
